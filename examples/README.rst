These examples assume that a PyACP server is already running. You can start it by running the following command from the root of the PyACP repository:

.. code::

    docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d

For further options to launch the PyACP server, see :ref:`launching_server`. You may have to adapt the paths passed to PyACP when using these options.
