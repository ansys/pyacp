Basic example of a full composite workflow with PyMechanical (without Workbench). Currently not part of the PyACP example suite.

Currently works with both the "remote" (remote_workflow.py) and "embedded" (embedded_workflow) PyMechanical.
Start in "embedded_workflow.py" for more documentation.

Works on Windows but could not be tested on Linux due to https://github.com/ansys/pymechanical/issues/352.
