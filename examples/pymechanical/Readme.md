Basic example of full composite workflow with pymechanical (without workbench). Currently not part of the pyacp example suite.

Currently works with both the "remote" (remote_workflow.py) and "embedded" (embedded_workflow) pymechanical.
Start in "embedded_workflow.py" for more documentation.

Tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu with WSL)
