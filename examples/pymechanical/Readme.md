This is an example of a full composite workflow using PyMechanical (without Workbench). It is currently not part of the PyACP example suite.

The example works with both "remote" (remote_workflow.py) and "embedded" (embedded_workflow) PyMechanical.
For the example's documentation, see "embedded_workflow.py".

This example works on Windows and could not be tested on Linux due to https://github.com/ansys/pymechanical/issues/352.
