This is an example of a shell workflow using PyMechanical, using the 'shim' defined
in the ``acp_future`` sub-directory. The shim enables running the workflow on both
remote and embedded PyMechanical.

Variants of this example _not_ using the shim have been integrated into the main
examples directory. However, these work only on Windows, and only with the remote
PyMechanical.

This example works on Windows, but could not be tested on Linux due to
https://github.com/ansys/pymechanical/issues/352.
