class FieldDefinition(CreatableTreeObject, IdTreeObject):
    """Instantiate a Field Definition.

    A field definition is used to configure the state of variable materials.
    For instance, a Lookup Table can be used to define the distribution of a
    state of material field (e.g. degradation). The field definition allows
    to define the material field per element or per ply and element.

    Note: Field definitions are currently only supported through (Py)Mechanical.
    The direct interface of PyACP to (Py)MADL ignores field definitions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    name :
        Name of the field definition.
    active :
        Inactive field definitions are ignored.
    field_variable_name :
        Links the material field to a field variable name.
        The field variable name must be defined in the material properties.
        Note that the ``Temperature`` and ``Shear Angle`` field variables are not available
        for Field Definitions. Temperature is defined through the solution and `Shear Angle`
        is defined via draping calculations.
    scope_entities :
        Define the scope of the field definition. You can use a combination
        of Element Sets and Oriented Selection Sets for elemental scope.
        For ply-wise field definitions, a combination of Modeling Plies can be selected.
        Note that the field definition is only applied to the Analysis Plies attached to
        the Modeling Plies. A combination of elemental and ply-wise definition is not supported.
    scalar_field :
        Select the scalar Look-Up Table column from which the state of the field
        variable is interpolated from.
    full_mapping :
        Specify to include the shell offset of each analysis ply for the interpolation process.
        The default is to interpolate the state of the field variables at the shell element centroid.
        For solid elements, the position of each analysis ply is automatically considered.
