    ----------
    value_type :
        Determines whether the column data is scalar (one entry per row) or
        directional (three entries per row).
        Note that the ``value_type`` can only be set when constructing the
        column, and is read-only afterwards.
    physical_dimension :
        Dimensionality (such as time, length, force, ...) of the column data.
    data :
        The column data. The shape of the data must match the ``value_type``
        and the length of the ``Location`` column of the parent look-up
        table.
