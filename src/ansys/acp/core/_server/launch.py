    """Launch an ACP instance.

    Launch the ACP gRPC server with the given configuration. If no
    configuration is provided, the configured default is used.

    .. warning::

        Do not execute this function with untrusted input parameters.
        See the :ref:`security guide<security_launch_acp>` for details.

    Parameters
    ----------
    config :
        The configuration used for launching ACP. If unspecified, the
        default for the given launch mode is used.
    launch_mode :
        Specifies which ACP launcher is used. One of ``direct``,
        ``docker_compose``, or ``connect``. If unspecified, the
        configured default is used. If no default is configured,
        ``direct`` is used.
    timeout :
        Timeout to wait until ACP responds. If ``None`` is specified,
        the check that ACP has started is skipped.
    auto_transfer_files :
        Determines whether input and output files are automatically
        transferred (up- or downloaded) to the server. If ``True``,
        files are automatically transferred, and all paths in the
        import or export methods are *local* paths. If ``False``,
        file transfer needs to be handled manually, and the paths
        are relative to the server working directory.
        If the ``launch_mode`` is ``"direct"``, this only has an
        effect if the current working directory is changed after
        launching the server.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        ACP instance which can be used to control the server, and
        instantiate objects on the server.
