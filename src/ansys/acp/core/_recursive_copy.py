    """Recursively copy a tree of ACP objects.

    This function copies a tree of ACP objects, starting from the given source objects.
    The copied tree includes all child objects. Linked objects (such as a Fabric linked to
    by a Modeling Ply) can optionally be included, controlled by the
    ``linked_object_handling`` argument.

    To specify where the new objects should be stored, you must provide a dictionary
    in the ``parent_mapping`` argument. The keys of the dictionary are the original
    parent objects, and the values are the new parent objects.
    Note that this mapping may need to contain parent objects that are not direct parents
    of the source objects, if another branch of the tree is included via linked objects.

    The ``parent_mapping`` argument can also include objects which are part of the
    ``source_objects`` list. In this case, the function will not create a new object for
    the parent, but will use the existing object instead.

    The function returns a ``dict`` mapping the original objects to the newly created
    objects.

    .. note::

        Only attributes supported by PyACP are copied to the new objects.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_objects :
        The starting point of the tree to copy.
    parent_mapping :
        A list of tuples defining where the new objects are stored. Each tuple contains
        the original parent object as the first element and the new parent object as the
        second element.
    linked_object_handling :
        Defines how linked objects are handled. An example of a linked object is a Fabric
        linked to by a Modeling Ply.

        The following options are available:

        - ``"keep"``: Keep linking to the original objects, and do not
          copy them (unless they are otherwise included in the tree).
        - ``"copy"``: Copy the linked objects, and replace the links.
        - ``"discard"``: Discard object links.

        Note that when copying objects between two models, only the ``"copy"`` and
        ``"discard"`` options are valid. If you wish to use links to existing objects,
        the ``"copy"`` option can be used, specifying how links should be replaced in
        the ``parent_mapping`` argument.

    Returns
    -------
    :
        A mapping of the newly created objects. The keys are the original objects,
        and the values are the new objects.

    Examples
    --------
    To copy all Modeling Groups and associated definitions from one model to another,
    you can use the following code:

    .. code-block:: python

        import ansys.acp.core as pyacp

        model1 = ...  # loaded in some way
        model2 = ...  # loaded in some way

            source_objects=model1.modeling_groups.values(),
            parent_mapping={model1: model2},
            linked_object_handling="copy",
        )

    To copy all definitions from one model to another, you can use the following code:

    .. code-block:: python

        import ansys.acp.core as pyacp

        model1 = ...  # loaded in some way
        model2 = ...  # loaded in some way

        pyacp.recursive_copy(
            source_objects=[model1],
