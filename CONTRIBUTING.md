We absolutely welcome any code contributions and hope that this
guide facilitates an understanding of the PyACP code
repository. It is important to note that while the PyACP software
package is maintained by Ansys and any submissions are reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this software
a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.
