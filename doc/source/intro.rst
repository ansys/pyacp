Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

PyACP supports Ansys version 2024R2 and later. To install PyACP, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install ansys-acp-core

You should use a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_,
because it keeps Python packages isolated from your system Python.
