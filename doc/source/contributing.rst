==========

We absolutely welcome all code contributions and hope that this guide facilitates
an understanding of the PyACP code repository. It is important to note that while
the PyACP software package is maintained by Ansys and any submissions are reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can support
user questions and develop new features to make this software a useful tool for
all users. As such, we welcome and encourage any questions or submissions to this
repository.

For example, you can make contributions as follows:

- Report a bug or suggest a feature.
- Give feedback or make suggestions for improving the documentation.
- Submit a pull request to fix a bug or add a feature.
- Report your use case, explain how PyACP has helped you, or indicate what features are still missing.

For feedback, suggestions, or bug reports, open an `issue
<https://github.com/ansys/pyacp/issues>`_ on the PyACP GitHub repository.
For code changes or documentation improvements, open a `pull request
<https://github.com/ansys/pyacp/pulls>`_.
